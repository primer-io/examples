# LLM Guide

## How to Use This Guide

This guide contains our comprehensive documentation consolidated onto a single page. The goal is to provide an easy way for you to give Large Language Models (LLMs) of your choosing context on how to use our components.

You can either:

- Download the file from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/path-to-file) and paste it into your LLM conversation
- Or simply share the link to this page with your LLM

The LLM will process all the text below, giving it a complete understanding of our component library. After providing this context, you can easily ask the LLM to build whatever you need using our components.

:::tip
For best results, ask the LLM to thoroughly review all the documentation before you begin asking implementation questions.

## Example Prompt

You can use the following example prompt with your LLM after sharing this guide:

```
Go to this page and analyze how you can use primer's checkout components to create our checkout. https://composable-checkout.vercel.app/documentation/llm-guide

Now, create a basic implementation using TypeScript and add custom layout where we take control over the order of the payment methods. So we can put PayPal on top and CardForm second and then the rest should follow.
```

This prompt directs the LLM to:

1. Review the documentation on our components
2. Create a TypeScript implementation
3. Customize the payment method order (PayPal first, CardForm second, followed by other methods)

Feel free to modify this prompt to match your specific implementation needs.
