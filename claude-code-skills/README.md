## When to Use Skills vs Context7

**Use Primer Skills when:**

- You're working in your IDE and want integrated assistance
- You need offline access to documentation
- You want best practices and patterns included automatically
- You're focused on implementation and troubleshooting

**Use Context7 when:**

- You want the absolute latest documentation updates
- You're using web-based LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude.ai)
- You need to verify against the live documentation
- You're researching new features or API changes

**Best Practice:** Use both together! The skill provides workflow guidance while Context7 ensures you have the latest API information.
